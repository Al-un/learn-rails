## Polls

### Scaffolds

Instead of manually create models, controllers and view, Rails offers
the awesome scaffold

```
rails generate scaffold poll topic:string
```

which outputs:

![Poll scaffold](screenshots/01.00_scaffold.png)

Our poll is meaningless without any choice. Let's add choices with
the scaffold option.

> Alternative is to generate only models with `rails generate model polls/choice`
> and the build our controller (`rails generate controller polls/choice`) and
> finally creating views

```sh
rails generate scaffold choice text:string poll:references
```

### Migrations

Before running our server, we need to update our database. Scaffold
nicely generated migrations so all we have to do is to execute 
migration. The migration is executed the database defined in 
environments variables:

```
rails db:migrate
```

Thanks to migrations, it is easy to update our models. Let's say we
want to add the `public` and `closed` fields to our polls:

```sh
rails generate migration AddPublicClosedToPoll public:boolean closed:boolean
```

I have added some default values:

```ruby
class AddPublicClosedToPoll < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.2]
  def change
    add_column :polls, :public, :boolean, default: true
    add_column :polls, :closed, :boolean, default: false
  end
end
```

Execute the migration:

```sh
rails db:migrate
```

That's it! To handle existing entries, especially non-nullable fields, multiple
migrations might be required.
